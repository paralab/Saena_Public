options for smoother: "jacobi", "chebyshev".

preSmooth: number of pre-smoothing

preSmooth: number of post-smoothing

PSmoother: Operartor smoother. options: "jacobi", "SPAI".

conn_str: connection strength parameter. The higher it is, the denser the matrices become, so more expensive each vcycle becomes. (Only for h-coarsening?)

dynamic_levels: Set it to "1" to let Saena decide about the number of multigrid levels. To disable set it to "0".

max_level: maximum number of multigrid levels.

float_level: switch from double to float matvec, so each matvec since that level and above will be cheaper but less accurate. Set it to a big number to disable this feature.

filter_thre: filter out (remove) matrix entries less than this threshold.

filter_max: filter_thre does not get larger than filter_max

filter_start: filtering starts at this level. cannot filter level 0. so it should be >= 1. Set it to a big number to disable filtering.

filter_rate: filter_thre will get larger with rate 10^filter_rate. Set it higher for a more aggresive filtering.

switch_to_dense: Set it to "1" to enable switching from sparse to dense matvec. Otherwise, set it to "0".

dense_thre: the density threshold to switch to dense matvec

options for petsc: "", "gamg", "ml", "boomerAMG", "dcg", "all"
